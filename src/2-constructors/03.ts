// Write a TypeScript class called Shape with properties like color. Implement a constructor that initializes the color property when a Shape object is created. Then, create a derived class Circle that extends Shape. Implement a constructor for the Circle class that takes color and radius as parameters and initializes them along with the color property of the base class.

class Shape {
    color: string

    constructor(color: string) {
        this.color = color
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape{
    radius: number

    constructor(color: string, radius: number) {
        super(color)
        this.radius = radius
    }
}

const myCircle = new Circle("Red", 3.14)

console.log(`My ${myCircle.color} circle has a ${myCircle.radius} radius.`)
